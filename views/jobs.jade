							| Every piece of packaging. Every swipe of the finger. Every â€œHow can I help you?â€ Everything. And it doesnâ€™t matter just some of the time. It matters all of the time. Thatâ€™s how we do things at Apple. The result is some of the best-loved products in the world.

							| Ask anyone here. Itâ€™s hard work. It means forever asking, â€œWhy is it this way?â€ and â€œHow can it be better?â€ It means rethinking every customer experience until the clutter has fallen away â€” until all that remains is whatâ€™s essential, useful, and beautiful. That might be a new product feature that delights even die-hard fans. It might be a customer support call, or even a display in an Apple store, arranged and lit exactly so.
